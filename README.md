# FakeNewsPredictor
This is the repository for a university project, where the purpose was to create a BINARY fake news predictor. The project uses FakeNewsCorpus (https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus) data to train upon. The project consists of two parts: First, to demonstrate a working PostgreSQL database with the data, which can be queried for interesting info. Second, to sort the different labels into two labels REAL and FAKE, train models on the data with these labels, and finally predict. The Prediction is done on the dataset itself with crossvalidation, as well as on two other datasets: The LIAR dataset (https://github.com/thiagorainmaker77/liar_dataset) and an 'unknown' dataset, which was set up as a Kaggle competition.
